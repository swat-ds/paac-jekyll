In 1847, Philadelphia Quakers conducted a census of the city's African American population.
Their intention was to document the existence of an "industrious and thriving" portion of
that population, and also to discover what sectors of the community may have been in need
of attention and assistance. Over 150 years later, the original data - held in manuscript at
the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College -  proves a rich resource for studying
African American history, genealogy, Philadelphia history, and more.
