The following data were taken from the original csv file that the 2002 exhibit uses, created by digitizing the 1847 census data collected by hand. The data categories shown were cleaned using OpenRefine, Python scripts, and Excel tools. Subsets of the data were used to create the visualizations housed on this site.
